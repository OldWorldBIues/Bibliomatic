# Bibliomatic
Bibliomatic is an app for learning math. Here you can create articles by adding the necessary data and a pdf document. Create tests to check your knowledge. There are 4 types of questions (single-answer questions, multiple-choice questions, matching questions, and open-ended questions). You can also add one picture and one formula to each question and answer. If you have created a test, you can view it and see the correct answers. If you are taking a test, you fill in your options and at the end you see the result of the test. Also, if you have created a test, you can see when, who and how many points this person scored, and if you have passed the test, you can see all your previous attempts, the number of points scored and the date of passing. You can also create your own questions (similar to StackOverflow, but about math). There is a text editor with a set of editing functions. Here you can see the question formatting and attached files (pictures, formulas, links). The same editor is available for the answer. Articles, tests and questions have a social panel. Here you can like or dislike a question, as well as leave a comment. If it is a question, you can mark the user's answer as a solution to your question. There is also a profile where you can edit it and see the content you have created.
